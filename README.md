<h2>Very common question</h2>
<strong>Why did I choose development?</strong/

The answer is simple - I love to create something new!

When the bosses come to me with another idea about creating a new service, additional automation, or just modifications to an existing project, I am simply thrilled that I can bring these projects to life with my own hands.

It is also interesting that this can be done using various tools.
Does the project need Go? - not a problem, we will master
Need a cool visual? - we already have a tool in stock

Therefore, by hiring me, you get an employee who sincerely loves his job, who will study and create everything necessary to release high-quality software to the market.
