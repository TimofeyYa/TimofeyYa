<h2>Very common question</h2>
<strong>Why did I choose development?</strong>

<p>The answer is simple - <i>I love to create something new!</i></p>

<p>When the bosses come to me with another idea about creating a new service, additional automation, or just modifications to an existing project, I am simply thrilled that I can bring these projects to life with my own hands.</p>

<p>It is also interesting that this can be done using various tools.
Does the project need Go? - not a problem, we will master
Need a cool visual? - we already have a tool in stock</p>

<p>Therefore, by hiring me, you get an employee who sincerely loves his job, who will study and create everything necessary to <b>release high-quality software to the market.</b></p>
<br>

<h2>My arsenal</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Data Base: SQL, Mongo, PostgreSQL</li>
  <li>Node JS: Express and other</li>
  <li>JavaScript: React, TypeScript and other</li>
